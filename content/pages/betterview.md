  title: A better view

    Amid increasing demand and rising political and patient expectations, clinical and managerial leaders have lacked support by not being given the information tools they need to do the hardest job in the world.

    We wanted to change this by creating a world where data flows automatically and is beautifully presented and organised according to priorities.

    The platform allows you to select any set of screens and send them on an ‘always-on’ basis to your screens on the wall – a locally configurable coordination hub in a box.

    description: |-
      SystemView allows users to drill to patient- and/or doctor-level data in six clicks or less. It’s not about being able to choose anything. Rather, via SystemView’s fixed logic, it’s about being guided to only the actionable information.

      We’re calling an end to monthly performance reporting. After all, this is often six weeks out of date anyway. We are committed to delivering only the relevant information at the frequency that the decisions need to be made.

    description: |-
      None of our analysis requires new collections of data. Our software collates huge arrays of routinely collected data that every hospital is already sourcing. What we do that no one has ever done is automate the management of the information so no one needs to manually compile it.

      We have created a visualisation framework that any authorised user can log on to. Housed within a hospital’s firewall, it is fully secure.
