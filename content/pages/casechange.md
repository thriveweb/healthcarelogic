    We all know that we spend vast amounts of money and time collecting and storing data - and not enough time understanding and acting on it.

    Modern EMRs save time and improve quality for clinicians by making the data most relevant for care intuitive to access and easy to use. The very best systems use clinical decision support to provide alerts for situations that require special attention.

    The problem is nobody is doing the same for the hospital as a whole.
