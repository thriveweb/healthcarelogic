    We all know that we spend vast amounts of money and time collecting and
    storing data - and not enough time understanding and acting on it.


    Modern EMRs save time and improve quality for clinicians by making the data
    most relevant for care intuitive to access and easy to use. The very best
    systems use clinical decision support to provide alerts for situations that
    require special attention.


    The problem is nobody is doing the same for the hospital as a whole.

        - Do you know the length of stay required in each of your treatment
        areas for the ED system to have flow? And is this updated every five
        minutes based on today’s variation in demand?

        - Do you know which patients have exceeded the required length of stay
        in each area and why? And what actions you can take to resolve this now?

        - Are all of your ED escalation pathways automated with real-time text
        and email alerts? Are your escalations happening before or after ED flow
        is blocked?

        - Do you know how many patients are predicted to present to ED in the
        following hour and for the rest of the day? And if within previous hours
        you have had higher than expected presentations?

        - Can you easily see the patients waiting for a ward admission or
        subspecialty review? And are the teams automatically notified via text
        or email at the minute these requests are made?

        - Can you see today’s inpatient ward discharges and their impact to ED
        patient flow?

        - Do you know how long it takes to triage patients that arrive by
        ambulance and how this impacts POST?

        cases?

        - Have you got automated red to green and AEP strategies?

        - Do you have an information system so teams across the hospital can
        agree which patients need special attention to prioritise care by acuity
        and system flow?

        - Are you still having frivolous bed meetings or escalations?

        - Do you know what lengths of stay each ward needs to make the whole
        system work?
