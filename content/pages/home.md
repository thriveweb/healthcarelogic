  title: Time to Shine a Light?
  subtitle: |-
    We asked a wide array of clinicians the following question:

    “How much automated data do you have available that is designed to help you improve the work of your team?”

    We thought the answer would be: “Not very much.” It wasn’t. The response was: “None”.

    It’s not a damn dashboard. It’s not about KPIs. It’s revolutionary technology that empowers clinical and managerial leaders to collaborate with clarity. With our suite of proprietary algorithms visualising consistent, high-frequency, patient-level data, the best decisions can be made for any given level of resource.

    And now we interact with the data in a completely new way including setting personal thresholds for active monitoring, sharing with colleagues and establishing personable discussion groups.
