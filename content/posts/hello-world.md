We at Healthcare Logic want to ensure that everyone has access to safe, quality care - regardless of their ability to pay. We do this by developing public hospital performance improvement software that automates capacity and demand analysis to help clinical and managerial leaders optimise care processes through high-frequency, patient/doctor-level, web-based analytics. The companyâ€™s flagship platform - SystemView - fosters collaboration, empowers teams, and creates significant return on investment. 

Healthcare Logic's CEO & Founder, Professor Martin Connor PhD, prepares insightful articles for healthcare professionals through this blog. The aim is to debunk myths, explore ideas and inspire new thinking on healthcare quality management to help improve hospital performance.
