Why are traditional performance reports monthly? Is it simply because that’s what businesses tend to do and public healthcare adopted the same approach in the mid 1980s? During a period of political optimism where ‘business efficiency’ was thought could help ‘public services’.



The root of the word monthly comes from the waxing and waning of the moon. This is linked in Western civilisation with the Roman-Empire and church-based evolution of the modern calendar. So, the reporting systems of modern, high-tech hospitals are driven by two epic arbitrarinesses – our nearest neighbour in the solar system and our modern version of the counting systems the ancient Egyptians used to predict the flooding of the Nile. Not just tangential but irrelevant to the delivery of care, in other words.



However, because monthly data is the currency of financial reimbursement and ‘performance management’ then this irrelevance cannot be acknowledged. Bureaucracies can’t tolerate ignorance, so they fill in the gaps in their understanding (often with myths). In the case of hospital performance data, we have created an industry to generate possible explanations of how monthly data tells us something, when in fact it tells us nothing.



This is why our clinical leaders and teams, when presented with monthly performance data, correctly say “so what?”as we can’t explain what it has to do with them or what they could do to change how it looks. If it was only wasteful, that would be bad, but it is worse - it drives a culture of negative judgment that sanctions the view that organisations or teams are lazy, or incompetent, or wilfully disregarding the public interest. 



From a technical point of view, the problem with monthly data is that it combines two forms of aggregation – time and scope. Monthly hospital or specialty surgical waiting lists don’t exist. They are fictions created to give the illusion of control and misleading aggregations of the real clinical situation – a set of individual patients awaiting treatment by an individual surgeon.



You can’t tackle a hospital surgical waiting list without authentic conversations with each surgeon who has a capacity and demand imbalance or problems treating patients in time.  And the same goes for Emergency Department teams, Outpatient teams and Wards.

These conversations need automated, patient-level, high frequency, team-centred data because when this data is presented, the response is never “so what?” it’s “A-ha!”.



Does a system like this exist? Yes - we call it SystemView, visit [healthcarelogic.com](https://www.healthcarelogic.com) for information on a system deployed in over 50 hospitals empowering teams and offering constant A-ha moments, and improving hospital performance.
