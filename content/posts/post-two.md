We’ve been on a journey for the last 25 years to understand and improve hospital performance. Since the first electronic medical record and patient administration systems were installed in the 1980s, there have been five waves of analytics. 

Firstly, monthly reports of activity and sometimes waiting times would appear in administrative offices and occasionally in team meetings on dot matrix print outs showing numbers in tables. Kind of interesting but not very meaningful.

Then in the late 1990s and early 2000s came the beginning of patient level data analysis, driven by the march of performance management. Due to the political/executive complex that sought to control clinical team behaviour and the parallel rise of quality improvement movement (inspired by book releases including To err is human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, published by the U.S. Institute of Medicine). 

This range of techniques followed the rubric of the snapshot extraction of specific data sets and then typically Microsoft Excel warriors would make sense of it, offering powerful and insightful messages. 

Also as a part of the second wave, the benchmarking incumbents were founded and secured their market share, enabling for the first time a consistent comparison between hospitals and teams.

In the third wave, a smattering of automated software products emerged offering insights into relatively narrow areas of the hospital. Some products would redraw a surgical or outpatient waiting list, or give an image of an Emergency Department, or draw maps of where referrals were coming from. Each application had its own interface and connectors meaning they could never describe the whole system.

We are now well into the fourth wave, with powerful BI visualisation tools operating over real time data ‘lakes’ (or ‘warehouses’, or ‘stores’, or ‘reservoirs’ – pick your metaphor). With minimal training any person can show any chart type of any two numbers from any time period. This wave should represent a significant step forward but isn’t driving the cultural change that was hoped. How can this be?

The reason is, that access to the data and the ability to visualise it by itself doesn’t drive meaning. And without meaning, it can’t indicate actions. Without indicating actions, it doesn’t challenge us to confront the relationships within teams that we need to show the right cooperative behaviours to deliver truly patient-centred care.

It’s time for the fifth wave - Fully automated, patient and team centred, action driving, whole system, interactive and social with active system monitoring using embedded push notifications. This is the platform hospitals need to move relationships and performance to the next level, safely and cost-effectively. This has been Healthcare Logic’s specific passion for the last five years and it is now ready.
