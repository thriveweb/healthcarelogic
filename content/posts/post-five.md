Thinking about access problems in emergency departments, wards, or waiting lists for outpatients or surgery, there are only three categories of problem to explain the issue: true capacity and demand imbalance, behaviours, or systems and processes.



To have a true capacity and demand imbalance, a service has to have a chronic and persistent lack of resources such that no form of organisation can deliver the number of events indicated by appropriate requests for service. If we were to accept the default position of public hospitals most of the time, it would appear that there were massive true capacity and demand imbalances in every team all of the time. But that is because the usual headline measures lie. Long waits in Emergency Department, huge and long waiting lists for Outpatients, huge and long waiting lists for Surgery and high numbers of patients waiting too long in hospital beds do not signify true capacity and demand imbalances. What they signify is that there might be a true capacity and demand imbalance.



Clinical behaviours that aren’t mindful of the whole system can cause these access problems even when there is no underlying capacity and demand imbalance. Consider the multi-disciplinary teams that aren’t organised to complete board rounds early in the morning. Or teams that won’t respond promptly to requests from Emergency Department for review or admission. Or won’t process referrals in a timely or consistent way. Or who allow outpatient clinic capacity to be opened and closed without control. Or who select patients out of time-order for assessment or treatment. All these types of behaviours will cause huge variations in supply that will drive long waiting and cause problems irrespective of demand.



It is systems and processes that help or hinder on both sides of the capacity/demand equation. What if there is nothing in place to ensure consistent triage? Or no professionally accepted rule to ensure chronological management within urgency categories? Or no process to drive early-day discharges? Or no means of knowing that one of our surgeons is both doing predominantly trauma work in theatres and listing high numbers of patients from clinic for elective procedures? Or no mechanism for understanding how our scarce theatre and clinic time should be allocated between specialties? Or no process to manage the volumes of review patients in our outpatient services? Without these basic disciplines and rules, no service can appropriately respond to the real needs of the population it is trying to serve.



Without actionable (disaggregated, patient-level and team-centred) data, it is impossible to determine whether a particular access problem is one of capacity and demand, behaviour, or system and process. If we get this diagnosis wrong we will make the problem worse.  And without actionable data, we can’t know how to intervene or whether our interventions are working. 

So the task for public hospitals everywhere is clear. Establish the right systems and processes, align the behaviours and use targeted investment to tackle true capacity and demand imbalances. And to do all of this requires actionable data.
