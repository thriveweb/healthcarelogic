In their seminal 2001 paper The challenge of complexity in health care, Paul Plsek and Trish Greenhalgh lay out the basis for a different way to see things:

“Newton's ‘clockwork universe’ in which big problems can be broken down into smaller ones, analysed, and solved by rational deduction, has strongly influenced both the practice of medicine and the leadership of organisations. However the machine metaphor lets us down when no part of the equation is constant, independent, or predictable. 

A complex adaptive system is a collection of individual agents with freedom to act in ways that are not always totally predictable, and whose actions are interconnected so that one agent's actions changes the context for other agents. 

In mechanical systems boundaries are fixed and well defined; for example, knowing what is and is not a part of a car is no problem. Complex systems typically have fuzzy boundaries. Membership can change, and agents can simultaneously be members of several systems. This can complicate problem solving and lead to unexpected actions in response to change.”

This shift from linear to biological metaphors feels right, and can give us a lens of compassion through which we can view some of the challenges of trying to improve care.  Instead of seeing senior clinician resistance to change as stubbornness or conservatism, we can understand it as a legitimate vocational fear of the unknown that contributes to a preserving homeostasis within the clinical system.

And the problem comes when this homeostasis preserves the system in a state that doesn’t serve patients well. For example, a hospital with chronic long waiting in Emergency Department, delays in appropriate discharge, inability of referred patients to access clinics or an inability to treat surgical patients in time after they have been added to a waiting list are examples of systems that have ‘settled’ at a point where patient interests are not being served.

But how can we build the case for change, translate any proposed change into a team’s actual practice or monitor the impact of any changes we might propose? We need a new view of data.

We can think of healthcare information as being of three types:

Micro, which is the patient record and documentation, or the wide variety of summary information directly related to case management.

Meso, which relates to cohorts of patients, capacity and demand, flow through systems and service effectiveness.

Macro, which is used to report to funders or regulators.

Public healthcare systems have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in reliable, at-scale capture and reporting systems for the micro and the macro level; but where are the industry standard platforms for meso?

So we can support our clinicians at the bedside (still imperfectly, but at least with some technology) and we can monitor, evaluate and reimburse hospitals with some consistency.  But when we want automated, patient-level information to engage clinical teams in authentic conversations about care system reform, we’re on our own.

This has been our focus for the last five years and it is now ready - SystemView automates capacity and demand analysis to help clinical and managerial leaders optimise care processes through high-frequency, patient/doctor-level, web-based analytics. The platform fosters collaboration, empowers teams, and creates significant return on investment. Find out more at [healthcarelogic.com](https://www.healthcarelogic.com)
